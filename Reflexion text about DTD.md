Here I would like to compare a bit the difference between the first exercise with DTD and this one, in TEI. DTD, like XML-TEI, allows for a text structure with similar elements, particularly for the header. The body of the text does not change greatly, as the same structures are used. However, DTD is less flexible than TEI and allows for less detail, or if it does, it is much more time-consuming. TEI allows validation to be maintained where each change renders DTD obsolete. In the context of poetry, TEI is particularly valuable because it allows descriptions down to the syllable level. I managed to analyse the rhymes for DTD, but it was very tedious, whereas in TEI I had much less trouble analysing the rhymes in detail. 
In particular, DTD does not allow for as much flexibility and attention to detail as TEI does.I remember not being able to do everything I wanted to do during assignment 1, limiting myself to describing the ABAB rhyme scheme without anything else, whereas I encountered fewer difficulties here.  However, I would have liked to be able to talk about stylistic devices, which I was unable to do despite consulting the documentation. 
So, I can say that TEI propose possibilities you do not have in DTD, and permit more flexibility. Now I would like to learn how describe figures of speech in TEI-XML
