# A French poetry corpus : *Le Lac* by Alphonse de Lamartine, *L'Albatros* by Charles Baudelaire and *La courbe de tes yeux* by Paul Eluard. 
For the second step, we must be able to write a .readme file presenting our project, materials and approach. We also have to encode the texts in three xml files with the TEI_all scheme and then write a reflection text to explain our approach, and the knowledge we have acquired during this exercise.
As for the first step, I chose to work on three French poems from the 19th and 20th centuries: *Le Lac* by Alphonse de Lamartine, *L'Albatros* by Charles Baudelaire, and *La courbe de tes yeux* by Paul Eluard.
