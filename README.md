# A French poetry corpus : *Le Lac* by Alphonse de Lamartine, *L'Albatros* by Charles Baudelaire and *La courbe de tes yeux* by Paul Eluard. 
For the second stage, we must be able to write a .readme file presenting our project, our materials and our approach. We must also encode our texts in three xml files using the TEI_all schema, then write a reflective text explaining our approach and the knowledge we have acquired during this exercise. For the first stage, I have chosen to work on three French poems from the 19th and 20th centuries: Le Lac by Alphonse de Lamartine, L'Albatros by Charles Baudelaire and La courbe de tes yeux by Paul Eluard. I now want to encode these poetic texts in order to highlight their rich structures in terms of stylistic devices and rhymes. I am very interested in poetic patterns and would like to help readers understand poetry. This allows you to really structure the poem without getting lost in the meaning, which is not always understandable at first glance. I really enjoy working on these poems, which I studied in preparatory class on the themes of travel, time, and nature, the latter being particularly prominent in the two 19th-century poems. The 20th-century poem do not seem to the others, but I love it so much and I would like to encode him to. With the exception of  the English language and once for the metric scheme, I did not use AI. I would have liked to be able to encode stylistic devices, but I preferred not to use AI, keeping things simpler rather than the opposite.
